# VocabularyApp 
This readme is supposed to sketch the idea for a vocabulary app and to think it through.
You can add any ideas you have.

# 1. Goals of app.

    1.1. Learning vocabularies: App can approximately tell user's knowledge on vocabularies.
  
# 2. Workflow of app.

    2.1 User's viewpoint on vocabularies:
    The application has three dimensions. Each dimension gives a different view on the to-study-vocabularies.
  
    First dimenson: The chapter dimension.
    The chapter dimension lets the student see/learn the vocabularies per book chapter or different categories.
    Indication of proficiency level: Circle with different colors: red, yellow, green. Each vocab gets a different color depending on the     numbers it has been reviewed by the user. Once each vocabulary has a green level the whole circle appears green and adequately for the 
    other levels.
    
    Second dimension: The vocabulary box dimension.
    Suppose, the vocabulary box has six sections. The number six supposed to denote the number of days in a week [minus Sunday, this is a     free day from work and from studying vocabularies. :) ]
    
    Third dimension: ?? Jensijoon, help me out here! :D
    
    2.2 Internal viewpoint on vocabulary:
      2.2.1. How to track user's proficiency level?
      We basically want to introduce a system which can help the user with two tasks. The first task is to give him introduction to how         many times to study what vocabulary. The second taks is to give him an indication of his proficiency level of a word and this level       being approximately as close as possible to the reality.
      
      In order to help him with the two tasks the application works with vocabulary box dimension. The vocabulary boxes have been a really       adequate tool in real life to study vocabularies. It is a simple concept and this can help the application to track performance the       same way the boxes do. As indicted before, we suppose our vocabulary box has 6 levels.
      First task: How many times should one vocabulary be studied?
      Each level contains a number of vocabularies. 
      In the vocabulary app indicates the number of times a level needs to be studied can be as follows:
      Level 1: Level needs to studied each day.
      Level 2: Level needs to be studied every 2nd day.
      Level 3: Level needs to be studied every 3rd day.
      Level 4: Level needs to be studied every 4th day.
      Level 5: Level needs to be studied every 5th day.
      Level 6: Level needs to be studied every 6th day.
      This above is to obtain the fullest proficiency. Now, the user does not necessarily have to follow the guide with one what day to       study what vocabulary. The app on the other hand will count the number he was supposed to learn a vocabulary and will not give         the proficiency level until the user has iterated the number the app makes him do so.
