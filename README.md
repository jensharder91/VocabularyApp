# VocabularyApp

# 1. Goals of app.

Learning vocabularies: App can approximately tell user's knowledge on vocabularies.

# 2. How does it work.

Vocabulary cards are organized in 6 boxes. Cards in box 1 are unknown to the user, cards in box 6 are well learned. 
Students can test there knowledge in a short period of time (e.g. while waiting for the bus). 10 vocabularies are chosen randomly from all selected / learned categories. The student can repeat this multiply times to get an overview how solid his vocabulary knowledge is.
If the user knows a vocabulary during the learning session, the vocabulary moves to the next box, otherwise the vocabulary card returns to the first box in order to repeat this card.

If used regularly, the app will decide which vocabularies are due to learn to get a excellent result.
